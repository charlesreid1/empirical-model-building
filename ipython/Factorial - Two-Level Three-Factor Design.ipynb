    "As with other notebooks in this repository, this notebook follows, more or less closely, content from Box and Draper's _Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces_ (Wiley, 1984). This content is covered by Chapter 4 of Box and Draper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll carry out an anaylsis of a full factorial design, and show how we can obtain inforomation about a system and its responses, and a quantifiable range of certainty about those values. This is the fundamental idea behind empirical model-building and allows us to construct cheap and simple models to represent complex, nonlinear systems.\n",

The more samples are taken at this condition, the better characterized the distribution of uncertainty becomes. These center point samples can be used to construct a Gaussian probability distribution function, which yeilds a variance, $\\sigma^2$ (or, to be proper, an estimate $s^2$ of the real variance $\\sigma^2$).

The design of the experiment was made simple by using the `itertools` and `pandas` libraries, and we showed how to transform variables to have low and high levels, as well as demonstrating a system response transformation. The results were analyzed to obtain a linear polynomial model.\n",
